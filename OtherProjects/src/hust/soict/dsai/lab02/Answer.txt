If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Yes, Java allows us to create multiple constructor methods for a class, each with a different set of parameters.
This is known as constructor overloading. 
We can create a constructor method to build a DVD by title, and another constructor method to build a DVD by category, as long as they have different parameter lists
